Welcome to Arpe1s' home on the web!

I was a CTF player majoring in cryptography at Cohesion Network Security Studio [(CNSS)](https://blog.cnss.io/) from 2018 to 2020.

I have got postgraduate recommendation to be a Master candidate at Institute of Information Engineering (IIE), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) in 2021. And my major research topics are Homomorphic Encryption and Lattice-based Cryptography. 

I will receive my Bachelorâ€™s degree from Mathematical Sciences at University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) in July, 2021.
